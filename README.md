# Scale, absolutely!
A RoboFont extension to scale points, absolutely!
- it adds option to Inspector, where you can choose if you wish to scale absolutely or not.
- it saves state of your latest option, so you don't have to always set it with opening a new inspector.

## plans
- live transform will show absolute values as well
- input window will support math operations and variable of vertical metrics. Thanks, Renan!
- shortcuts for scaling in both directions on both axes


## history of versions
- 0.3 - extension now has memory for inputs of absolute and relative scaling. Scale absolutely, go relative and then back to absolute and your values are loaded back. When you are scaling a contour, the extension shows absolute width and height in current scale transformation settings, the same as you scale in relative mode.
- 0.2 - bug fix, wrong plist
- 0.1 - initial version


For the absolute scalers :)
